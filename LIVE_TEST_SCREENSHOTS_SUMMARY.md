## Deployment Recommendations

Based on live testing results, the container is **PRODUCTION READY** with:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"      # Based on 28.4% observed average
    memory: "300Mi"  # Based on 250MB observed + buffer
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"      # Conservative upper limit  
    memory: "512Mi"  # Generous allocation for peak usage
```

## Comparison with Previous Testing

| Metric | Previous Report | Live Test Results | Status |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Resolution** | 1024x768 configured | ‚úÖ 1024x768 validated | **Confirmed** |
| **CPU Usage** | 25.9% average | 28.4% average | **Excellent** |
| **Memory Usage** | 1.56% (249MB) | 1.56% (250MB) | **Consistent** |
| **Container Size** | 1.8GB | 1.8GB | **Confirmed** |
| **Process Stability** | Validated | ‚úÖ All processes running | **Proven** |
| **Visual Evidence** | Performance data | ‚úÖ 13 screenshots captured | **Enhanced** |

## Conclusion
